This is an implementation of a subset of C# in the [Spoofax Language Workbench][1]. Its syntax is declared in SDF3,
and its semantics are declared in Statix. This version only supports the syntactic and semantic analysis, and can
neither run nor produce a C# class file.

The implementation is based on the [ECMA-334 standard][2].
See [the documentation](https://metaborgcube.github.io/metaborg-mini-csharp/) for more info.
